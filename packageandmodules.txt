No, you should not import main as a package in other Go files or packages.


Why?
The main package in Go is special: it's the entry point for an executable program.

It cannot be imported by other packages because it's meant to produce a standalone executable, not a reusable library.

If you try to import a package named main, the compiler will complain or it simply won't work as intended.

What to do instead?
If you want to reuse code from your main package, move that reusable code into a separate package (in another folder) with a meaningful name.

Then, import that package both in your main package (for executable) and in other packages if needed.
